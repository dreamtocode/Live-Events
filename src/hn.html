            <p>HackerNest is an international nonprofit community movement focused on building supportive Silicon Valley like tech communities in every city - strengthening local tech ecosystems globally through unpretentious social events and hackathons. We are nurturing cohesive communities today to empower them with more relevant and accessible peer-based tech education tomorrow.</p>
            <p>We're not scienticians, but the formula seems to work: we became Canada's largest tech meetups in a year, before even leaving Toronto. Today we have "splinter cells" in multiple cities internationally.

Our goal is to complement and strengthen existing nerd ecosystems  we come in peace. This is not a business; nobody owns HackerNest. Conceptually, it is the ideal of a strong and supportive tech community  pretty much anyone that isn't a jerk can be a part of it.</p>
